## Review (Plan 1)
- Library: throttled client, TTL cache, typed models, async Explorer poller, name resolution, aggregation.
- CLI: health, labels, label-groups, iplists, services, workloads, policy (rulesets, rules, pending), traffic query (flows, --group, --blocked, --dry-run), profile (list, use).
- Verified: `cargo test --workspace`, clippy clean, live smoke test against demo100 (50 flows in 9 API calls, 278 KB).
- Deferred to Plan 2: the interactive TUI, auto-refresh, `:profile` switching at runtime.

## Plan 2: TUI
- [x] Task 1 TUI core: model, messages, pure update, theme, chrome view, snapshots
- [x] Task 2 Runtime: terminal, event loop, command executor, startup
- [x] Task 3 Table state (sort, search, selection, scrolling) and its renderer
- [x] Task 4 Command prompt, help overlay, status errors
- [x] Task 5 Traffic filter model, filter bar, editor, cost hint, confirmation
- [x] Task 6 Traffic query execution: run, progress, cancel, results
- [x] Task 7 Flow table view, detail pane, header stats (decision bar, sparkline, age)
- [x] Task 8 App-to-app aggregate and blocked views, view cycling, drill-down
- [x] Task 9 Opt-in auto-refresh with countdown, focus and running guards
- [x] Task 10 Policy screen: rulesets, rules (allow + deny), draft/active, detail, pending
- [x] Task 11 Labels & objects screen
- [x] Task 12 Workloads screen and the jump to Traffic
- [x] Task 13 Profile switching, draft/active commands, disconnected recovery, error overlay
- [x] Task 14 Mouse support, light-theme snapshots for every screen, key-map polish
- [x] Task 15 VEN health: derived agent status, CLI `--unhealthy`, Workloads screen health
- [x] Task 16 Events: library model and filter, facade, CLI command, recorder
- [x] Task 17 Events screen
- [x] Task 18 Docs, README, task review, final gate

## Review (Plan 2)
- Interactive TUI: five screens (Traffic with Flows / App-to-app / Blocked, Policy, Labels & objects, Workloads with VEN health, Events), `:` commands, help overlay, filter editor with cost guard, opt-in auto-refresh that switches itself off on failure, profile switching, error overlay, mouse (wheel, tab click), dark and light themes.
- Final gate green: `cargo fmt --all --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test --workspace`.
- Events fixture recorded once from the test PCE (the recorder records every set, so 15 read calls, not one) into a scratch directory; the anonymiser was extended for `pce_fqdn`, `src_ip` and `api_key_id`, an `xtask anonymise` subcommand added, the file re-processed, audited per key and committed as `fixtures/recorded/events.json`. `cargo test -p pce --test recorded` green.
- Manual run against the test PCE at 100x30 through a pseudo-terminal: connect 5 calls; `r` 9 calls (1000 flows, truncation warning visible); `v` `v` no calls; `2` 10; `3` 10 (cache hits); `4` 11 (206 workloads, health summary shown); `h` no calls; `5` 12; `?` overlay; `q` exit 0. Final header: 12 API calls. Alternate screen left and mouse reporting disabled on exit.
