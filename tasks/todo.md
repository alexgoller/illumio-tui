## Review (Plan 1)
- Library: throttled client, TTL cache, typed models, async Explorer poller, name resolution, aggregation.
- CLI: health, labels, label-groups, iplists, services, workloads, policy (rulesets, rules, pending), traffic query (flows, --group, --blocked, --dry-run), profile (list, use).
- Verified: `cargo test --workspace`, clippy clean, live smoke test against demo100 (50 flows in 9 API calls, 278 KB).
- Deferred to Plan 2: the interactive TUI, auto-refresh, `:profile` switching at runtime.
